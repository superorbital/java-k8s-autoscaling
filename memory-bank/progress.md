# Progress: Kubernetes Autoscaling Demo

## What Works
- Spring Boot application with CPU and memory load generation endpoints
- Kubernetes deployment configuration with multiple resource scenarios
- HPA configuration for CPU-based and memory-based autoscaling
- Monitoring setup with Prometheus and Grafana
- Load testing configuration with k6 for different scenarios
- Enhanced demo script to illustrate how resource requests/limits affect autoscaling

## What's Left to Build
- Test the enhanced demo script with all resource configuration scenarios
- Verify the memory load generation endpoint works correctly under load
- Consider creating dedicated Grafana dashboards for resource utilization visualization
- Gather feedback on the enhanced demo's effectiveness

## Current Status
- **Docker Image**: 
  - Updated base image from `eclipse-temurin:17-jre-alpine` to `amazoncorretto:17-alpine` to resolve build issues
  - Implemented multi-stage Docker build to eliminate need for local Java installation
  - Modified JVM settings to use explicit heap sizes instead of percentage-based allocation
- **Application**: 
  - Fully implemented with endpoints for CPU and memory load generation
  - Added new `/api/memory-load` endpoint to demonstrate memory-based scaling
  - Added missing main application class required for Spring Boot
  - Optimized JVM memory settings to prevent premature scaling with memory-based HPA
- **Kubernetes Config**: 
  - Created multiple deployment configurations to demonstrate different resource scenarios:
    - Baseline configuration (CPU: 200m, Memory: 256Mi)
    - High CPU request configuration (CPU: 400m, Memory: 256Mi)
    - Low CPU request configuration (CPU: 100m, Memory: 256Mi)
    - Memory-focused configuration (CPU: 200m, Memory: 384Mi)
  - Created corresponding HPA configurations for each deployment
  - Enhanced HPA memory example to include both CPU and memory metrics at 80% thresholds
  - Updated documentation to explain JVM and HPA interaction
- **Monitoring**: Configured but needs verification after successful deployment
- **Load Testing**: 
  - Created specialized load tests for each resource configuration scenario:
    - Standard CPU load test for baseline configuration
    - High-intensity CPU load test for high CPU request configuration
    - Moderate-intensity CPU load test for low CPU request configuration
    - Memory-focused load test for memory-based scaling demonstration
  - Updated to use the new TestRun CRD instead of the deprecated K6 CRD
  - Configured Prometheus metrics output for k6 tests
  - Created service monitors for k6 metrics collection
- **Development Workflow**:
  - Created `rebuild-deploy.sh` script to automate the rebuild and redeploy process
  - Created `dev-mode.sh` script for local development with hot reloading
  - Created `monitor.sh` script to set up monitoring terminals
  - Created `run-demo-enhanced.sh` script to demonstrate how resource requests/limits affect autoscaling

## Known Issues
1. **Docker Build Error**: Original base image `eclipse-temurin:17-jre-alpine` could not be resolved
   - **Status**: Addressed by switching to `amazoncorretto:17-alpine`
   - **Verification**: Successful build confirmed

2. **Potential Alpine Compatibility**: Alpine Linux might have compatibility issues with some Java applications
   - **Status**: To be monitored during testing
   - **Mitigation**: If issues arise, consider switching to a non-Alpine base image

3. **Health Check Dependencies**: The health check uses wget which must be available in the container
   - **Status**: Addressed by explicitly installing wget in the Dockerfile
   - **Verification**: Pending runtime test

4. **Local Java Requirement**: Original build process required Java installed locally
   - **Status**: Resolved by implementing multi-stage Docker build
   - **Verification**: Successful build confirmed

5. **Missing Main Application Class**: Spring Boot application was missing the main class
   - **Status**: Resolved by creating `AutoscaleDemoApplication.java`
   - **Verification**: Successful build confirmed

6. **Deprecated K6 CRD**: The K6 CRD used for load testing has been deprecated
   - **Status**: Resolved by updating to the new TestRun CRD
   - **Verification**: Pending execution test

7. **Pod Termination Error**: Pods were going into Error status when terminated by Kubernetes
   - **Status**: Resolved by implementing graceful shutdown in the Spring Boot application
   - **Verification**: Successful deployment confirmed, pending pod termination test

8. **JVM Memory Allocation and HPA Interaction**: Percentage-based JVM heap settings causing premature scaling with memory-based HPA
   - **Status**: Resolved by using explicit heap sizes (-Xms410m -Xmx410m) instead of percentage-based allocation
   - **Verification**: Pending testing with memory-based HPA

## Upcoming Milestones
1. **Enhanced Demo Testing**: Verify all scenarios in the enhanced demo work correctly
2. **Memory Load Testing**: Confirm memory load generation and scaling works as expected
3. **User Feedback**: Gather feedback on the enhanced demo's effectiveness
4. **Visualization Improvements**: Consider creating dedicated Grafana dashboards for resource utilization
