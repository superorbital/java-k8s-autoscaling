# Project Brief: Kubernetes Autoscaling Demo

## Project Overview
This project is a demonstration of Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) capabilities using a Spring Boot application. The application is designed to generate controllable CPU and memory load to showcase how Kubernetes can automatically scale resources based on demand.

## Core Requirements
1. Demonstrate Kubernetes HPA functionality with a real application
2. Provide endpoints to generate CPU and memory load on demand
3. Include monitoring tools (Prometheus and Grafana) to visualize the scaling
4. Include load testing capabilities to trigger autoscaling events
5. Package the application as a Docker container for Kubernetes deployment

## Goals
- Educational tool to understand Kubernetes autoscaling
- Demonstrate best practices for containerization and resource management
- Provide a complete end-to-end demo environment with monitoring
- Show both successful autoscaling and common mistakes/pitfalls

## Success Criteria
- Application successfully scales up under load
- Monitoring dashboards show resource utilization and scaling events
- Load tests can be run to demonstrate scaling in action
- Documentation clearly explains the concepts and implementation
